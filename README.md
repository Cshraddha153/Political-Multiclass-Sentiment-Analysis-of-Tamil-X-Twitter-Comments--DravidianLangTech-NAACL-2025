# Political Multiclass Sentiment Analysis of Tamil X Twitter Comments

Sentiment analysis is a vital task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that seeks to identify and categorize opinions expressed in text into predefined classes. In the political context, understanding public sentiment is crucial for getting opinions, addressing concerns, and shaping policies. The increasing prominence of social media platforms like X (Twitter) has made them rich repositories of real-time, diverse and expressive political discourse. This project focuses on Political Multiclass Sentiment Analysis of Tamil Comments (tweets) collected from Twitter (X).

The goal of this project is to classify political sentiments expressed in Tamil tweets into the following seven distinct categories:
1. Substantiated (ஆதாரப்பூர்வமானது),
2. Sarcastic (கிண்டல்),
3. Opinionated (தனிப்பட்டக்கருத்து),
4. Positive (நேர்மறை),
5. Negative (எதிர்மறை),
6. Neutral (நடுநிலை) and
7. None of the above (எதுவும்இல்லை).
